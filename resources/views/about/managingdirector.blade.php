            It is my pleasure to speak a few words for Regnum Group of Companies which I have seen to grow up from scratch to such a stage today when it tells about itself by service, performance and quality.It all started with Late Alhaj Abdur Rahman Sikdar from a small village of Dohar cameto Dhaka more than 50 years ago and started a cottage industry to manufacture chocolates in a very limited scale at the present plot of 191/1, Tejgaon-Gulshan Link Road,Tejgoan,C/A,Dhaka-1208 By his lone, devoted and tireless labor this cottage industry turned into Sony Chocolate Industries, the mother company of Regnum Group.As the eldest son of Late Alhaj Abdur Rahman Sikdar and late Rehana Rahman I feel proud to have a position in the Sony Chocolate Industries which was established by my father Late Alhaj Abdur Rahman Sikdar in the year 1981. After the departure of my father in the year 2007 I had to take over the responsibilities to carry on with the establishments he created. Realizing the need for expansion and diversification of business, Regnum Resource is the first company formed in the year 2004 to work independently but under the umbrella of Sony Chocolate Industries.It was however, incorporated as a Limited company in the year 2007 as Regnum Resource Ltd. Within a span of only 8 years Regnum Resource Ltd spread its wings over diversified field of activities to crystallize it into a group of companies.
